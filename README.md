Protein phosphorylation on histidine(H), arginine(R) and lysine(K), are non-canonical but important post-translational modifications (PTMs), involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes such as immune response, cancer metastasis and protein degradation across species. With the progression of H/R/K phosphorylation peptide enrichment technologies, many novel H/R/K phosphosites (p-sites) as well as phosphoproteins (p-proteins) have been identified in high-throughput manner.

Here, we report a webserver, GPS-HALP, histidine, arginine and lysine phosphorylation, for prediction of H/R/K p-sites, ranging from E. coli to H. sapiens. First, we build a phosphorylation pre-training dataset, including 1,624,460 phosphorylation amino acids on 211,587 proteins across 88 species. Ten physical-chemical features of sequences were extracted using GPS and iLearnPlus. Then, we use MAML technology to obtain the pre-trained parameters for downstream H/K/R tasks based on pre-trained integrated model. In the manner of histidine phosphorylation site prediction, we compared other existing tools and machine learning methods with GPS-HALP, which exhibited a comparative predicting performance in cross-validation. Besides the basic statistics, we also integrated knowledge from 22 public resources for the prediction, including tissue expression, immune cell expression, structure information and cancer mutations on potential p-sites.
